# Today I Learned (TIL)

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across various technologies and topics.

## Structure

This repository is organized by topic, where each directory contains related `.md` files:

```
topic-name/
├── specific-learning-1.md
├── specific-learning-2.md
└── specific-learning-3.md
```

## Categories

<!-- Add your topic directories here as you create them -->

- [git --force Vs --force-with-lease](./git/force-and-force-with-lease.md) -  TIL the difference between `--force` and `--force-with-lease`


## Usage

Each TIL is a standalone markdown file containing:
- A clear title
- The problem or concept
- The solution or explanation
- Code examples (if applicable)
- References or links

## Contributing

Feel free to browse, and if you find something useful, great! This is primarily for my own learning and reference.
